I am a PhD student in Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Windsor. My supervisors are [Chris Lee](http://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/civil/92/dr-chris-lee/) and [Hanna Maoh](http://www.uwindsor.ca/engineering/civil/91/dr-hanna-maoh). My research is about driver behavior and its role in traffic safety in mixed traffic flow (cars and heavy-vehicles). `I love R and Rstudio`.
